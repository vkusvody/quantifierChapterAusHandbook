\section{Introduction}

A number of volumes have shed light on the diversity of quantificational systems cross-linguistically (\citealt{keenanpaperno17,keenanpaperno12}; \citealt{bachetal95}). However, with the exception of a relatively small number of papers (\citealt{bowler17}, \citealt{bowernzentz12}, \citealt{bittnerhale95}, \citealt{evans95}, \citealt{laughren81}...), little work has been done on quantificational systems in Australian languages. This chapter aims to make some progress towards filling this gap. In this chapter, we give an overview of quantificational expressions in Australian languages based on data from 125 languages.

We do not assume a theoretical definition of quantifiers in this chapter (i.e., \citealt{heimkratzer98}); rather, we are generally concerned with lexical items that refer to quantities. This includes terms referring to vague quantities (translation equivalents to English \textit{many}, \textit{few}, \textit{several}\ldots), properties of sets (\textit{all}, \textit{some}, \textit{no}\ldots), cardinalities (\textit{one}, \textit{two}, \textit{three}\ldots), Wh-words referring to quantities (\textit{how many}, \textit{how much}), indefinite pronouns (\textit{someone}, \textit{something}\ldots), and terms referring to ``quantities'' of times (or \textit{cases}, in \citealt{lewis75}'s terminology) (\textit{always}, \textit{sometimes}\ldots). We do not discuss number marking in agreement systems, non-pronominal (in)definiteness, or other lexical items that have been theoretically argued to include quantifiers in their semantic denotations, e.g.\ modals.

We show that Australian languages use a variety of morphosyntactic strategies to express quantificational concepts.

\subsection{Our data}

% 49 = number of nPN languages (including isolates)
% 71 = number of PN languages (including isolates)

Our survey is based on data from 125 Australian languages. This data is drawn from 124 published grammars, grammatical sketches, and dictionaries, as well as personal communications with some language experts. We aim to have a sample that is genetically and areally balanced as possible; we draw on data from 71 Pama-Nyungan languages from 21 subgroups and 49 non-Pama-Nyungan languages from 18 families, as well as 7 language isolates (sometimes categorized within Pama-Nyungan or non-Pama-Nyungan) and two mixed languages. This sample includes language data from all of the Australian states save Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory.

When we report that a language ``has'' a quantifier, we mean that the sources that we consulted on the language document this quantifier.\footnote{Difficulty of working with translation...} We restrain from making strong claims about languages lacking certain quantificational
expressions, since there may be gaps in the collected data (particularly in older sources; quantifier terms were not frequently collected in older language descriptions). We typically present counts as proportions of the total number of languages in our sample, i.e., for a given quantificational expression, we note how many languages have it out of a total of 125.

Finally, we generally present data as it is given in the original sources. In a small number of  instances, we standardize some interlinear glosses and orthographies.


\section{General morphosyntactic properties of  quantifier terms in Australia}

In the following sections, we give an overview of the common morphosyntactic properties of Australian quantificational expressions. We discuss the prevalence of particular quantificational expressions in \S\ref{individquantsection}.

\subsection{Lexical category of quantifier terms}
A frequent morphosyntactic distinction used in the quantifier literature is between \textit{D-quantifiers} and \textit{A-quantifiers} \citep{partee95}. %p544
The former (`D' standing for `determiner') build expressions that, in their morphosyntax, are (possibly, parts of) arguments of predicates. The latter (`A' standing for adverbs, auxiliaries, affixes, argument-structure adjusters, and so on) are used directly to build predicates (cf.\ \citealt{keenan17qu}). Adverbs of quantification (like \textit{usually} or \textit{seldom}) are a paradigm case of the A-quantifiers.

We diagnose a given lexical item as a noun by its ability to host case marking and trigger agreement marking, as in (\ref{allerg}--\ref{agrmarking1}).\footnote{Australian languages are often described as lacking adjectives, which are generally indistinguishable from nouns with respect to their morphosyntactic properties (\citealt[67--68]{dixon02}; see also {\bf XXXX}'s chapter in this volume).}  Nominal quantifiers can typically stand alone as arguments, without any other associated noun, as in (\ref{agrmarking1}). Quantifiers are frequently documented in discontinuous NPs, as in (\ref{discconst}) (cf.\ \citealt[51--52]{louagieverstraete16}, who observe that quantifiers are the most frequent type of modifier to occur discontinuously in Australian languages).

  one \First\Min\Sarg.do.\Pst{} fish black.nailfish\\
  \glt `I got one black nailfish.'  \label{discconst}
\end{exe}


Many languages in our survey also have A-quantifiers; these languages can express quantificational concepts through verbal modifiers such as free adverbs (\ref{aquant2}) or affixes (\ref{aquant1}).
\begin{exe}
  \ex  \textsc{Garadjari (PN: Marrngu)} \hfill(\citealt[54]{sands89})
  \gll \textbf{wiridjardu}  nga-njari-djinja.\\

  \glt `He ate them all up.' \label{aquant2}

  \gll Gunj barri\textbf{-bebbe}-yame-ng.\\
  kangaroo 3a\textsc{p-distr}-spear-\textsc{pp}\\
  \glt `They each killed a kangaroo.'\\
  ([they]$_{key}$ [kangaroo-spear-bebbeh]$_{share}$, i.e.\ one kangaroo-killing per man) \label{aquant1}
\end{exe}

One generalization emerging from the last 30 years of typological work on quantification is that languages can lack D-quantifiers, but no language has been found to lack A-quantifiers \citep{introqnl}. Australian languages appear to conform to \cite{bachetal95}'s generalization in this respect. Furthermore, none of the languages in our survey appear to only use A-quantifiers; A-quantifiers always  occur in addition to D-quantifiers.  While the nature of our data precludes strong conclusions about the absence of A-quantification in any language in the sample, it is clear that Australian languages present an important descriptive lacuna in this area, and potentially typologically unattested quantifier systems.

\subsection{Syntactic patterns of modification}

Some quantifiers are restricted to modifying absolutive arguments in a very small number of languages in our survey ($<$10\ofy). To the best of our knowledge, this property is primarily described of adverbial quantifiers, as in (\ref{quantscope1})--(\ref{quantscope2}). However, \cite{harvey92} describes one nominal quantifier in Gaagudju, \textit{geegirr}, that is preferred (but not required) in combination with absolutive arguments (\ref{quantscope3}).

\begin{exe}
  \ex  \textsc{Warlpiri (PN: Ngumpin-Yapa)} \hfill(\citealt[15]{bowler17})
  \gll Wati-ngki \textbf{muku} rdilyki-pungu kurlarda-wati.\\
  man-\textsc{erg} all/completely break.\textsc{pst} spear-several\\
  \glt `The man broke all the spears.' \label{quantscope1}
  \ex \textsc{Mayali (nPN: Gunwinyguan)} \hfill(\citealt[233]{evans95})
  \gll Aban-\textbf{djangged}-bukka-ng.\\
  1$>$3\textsc{pl}-bunch-show-\textsc{pp}\\
  \glt `I showed them \textbf{the whole lot}.' \label{quantscope2}
    \ex  \textsc{Gaagudju (nPN: Isolate)} \hfill(\citealt[307]{harvey92})
  \gll ba-'rree-ng-ga=mba \textbf{geegirr} ma'rree-ya=mba \textbf{geegirr}.\\ 
  2\textsc{a-ie-fu}-take=\textsc{aug} all 1+2\textsc{a}-go.\textsc{fu=aug} all\\
  \glt `I will take all of you. We will all go.' \label{quantscope3}
\end{exe}

We note that this property does not extend to all of the quantifiers within a given language. For instance, Warlpiri has other (D-)quantifiers that are not restricted to modifying absolutive arguments.


\section{Semantic findings \label{individquantsection}}

In the following sections, we discuss the prevalence of particular quantificational expressions in the languages in our survey, and review the morphosyntactic strategies that the languages use to encode them.

\subsection{Expressing `many'/`much' \label{manymuchsection}}

The majority of the languages in our survey (109\ofy) have a lexical item that contributes a meaning like English `many,', i.e., that the cardinality of a set exceeds some contextual standard.\footnote{Only one language in our survey, the Gooniyandi mother-in-law language, is explicitly described as lacking a word for `many' (\citealt[636]{mcgregor89}).} We frequently find that languages  have more than one lexical item for `many,' as shown in (\ref{manypl1}). %(\ref{manypl2}). % in opposition to the popularized view that Australian languages have ``simple'' quantifier systems.

\begin{exe}
 \ex  \textsc{Yugambeh (PN: Ngumpin-Yapa)} \hfill(\citealt{sharpe98}) \label{manypl1}
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex \textit{kamaybu} `lots of,' `plenty,' `beyond four'
    \ex \textit{karal} `more,' `many,' `a lot,' `all,' `plenty'
    \ex \textit{walal}  `many' 
  \end{xlist} 
 % \ex  \textsc{Bardi (nPN: Nyulnyulan)} (\citealt{bowern12})  \label{manypl2}
 % \begin{xlist}
 %   \ex \textit{niimana}  `plenty,' `many'
 %   \ex \textit{ngarri} `a lot,' `much'
 %   \ex \textit{alboorr(oo)} `plenty,' `many'
 % \end{xlist} 
\end{exe}

We find that Australian languages do not lexically distinguish between quantification over count nouns versus mass nouns, i.e., the distinction between English `many' and `much.' One lexical item can therefore modify both count and mass nouns, as in (\ref{manymuch1}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Biri (PN: Maric}) \hfill(\cite[54]{terrill98}) \label{manymuch1}
\begin{xlist} 
\ex  \gll  yara    \textbf{dhalgari}    mari        wuna-lba-dhana \\
    there    many        men-\textsc{abs}    lie-\textsc{cont-pst}-3\textsc{pl}S/A \\
    `Many men used to live here.'
\ex \gll \textbf{dhalgari}    gamu        wara-mba-li        gunhami    gamu     yinda-lbaŋa-la  \\   
    much        water-\textsc{abs}    be\textsc{-caus-pst}    that-\textsc{abs}    water-\textsc{abs}  rise-\textsc{cont-pres}-3\textsc{sg}S/A\\
    `Much rain made the river rise.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

An exception to this is the use of lexical items for `big' to express a quantity meaning akin to English `much.' (At least) 12/109 languages in our sample permit their lexical item for `big' to refer to `a large quantity of [noun];' this almost always occurs in combination with mass nouns, as in (\ref{bigquant1}).\footnote{\citet[37]{louagieverstraete16} assert that in Gooniyandi, prenominal `big' functions as a quantifier, whereas postnominal `big' has an adjectival meaning:
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \begin{exe}
      \ex  \textsc{Gooniyandi (nPN: Bunuban)} \hfill(\citealt{mcgregor90})
      \begin{xlist}
      \begin{multicols}{2}
        \ex \gll \textbf{nyamani} gamba\\
        big water \\
        \glt `a lot of water'% (McGregor 1990: 260) 
        \ex \gll yoowooloo \textbf{nyamani} \\
        man big \\
        \glt `a big man' %(McGregor 1990: 265)
    \end{multicols}
      \end{xlist}
    \end{exe}
  } Only two of these languages permit `big' to combine with count nouns under a quantity reading, as in (\ref{bigquant2}).\footnote{
  In Miriwoong (nPN: Jarrakan), the lexical item \textit{ngerreguwung} `big' can undergo partial reduplication to result in \textit{ngerregungerreguwung} `a very large number'/`very many' (\citealt[43]{kofod78}).
  }$^{,}$\footnote{We find that in one language, Murrinh-Patha, `big' can be used to express universal quantificational force. It is capable of both mass and wholistic quantificational readings.
  %,i.e.\ if the head noun denotes either a mass substance or an entity with understood internal structure (whether collective (herd) or not ( the whole house))
  
\begin{exe}
\ex  \textsc{Murrinh-Patha (nPN: Southern Daly)}\hfill (John Mansfield, p.c.)
\gll Me-Ngala mup-ka \textbf{ngala} kanam-ka-wat-nime.\\
foot-big people-\textsc{top} big be.3\textsc{sg.nfut-pauc.subj}-frequent-\textsc{pauc.m}\\
`The whole Big Foot mob come here regularly.'
\end{exe}
}

\begin{exe}
  \ex \textsc{Garrwa (nPN: Garrwan)} \hfill(\citealt{furby77}) \label{bigquant1}
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex \gll \textbf{walgu\v{r}a} wadjili \\
    big wild.honey\\
    \glt `a lot of wild honey,' `much wild honey' % p. 23
    \ex \gll \textbf{walgu\v{r}a}-nanji duŋala-nanji\\
    big-\textsc{abl} hill-\textsc{abl}\\
    \glt `from the big hill' % p. 33
\end{xlist}    
  \ex \textsc{Kalaw Kawaw Ya (PN: Western Torres Strait)} \hfill(\citealt[141]{fo91}) \label{bigquant2}
  \gll Yan burumiya lumiz +war moebaygan nanga burum        \textbf{koeyma}    mathan.\\
  in.vain pig.\textsc{com} hunt.\textsc{pr.pf} other person.\textsc{erg} when   pig.\textsc{abs}    big.\textsc{adv}    kill.\textsc{pr.pf}\\
  \glt `He hunted in vain for a pig while the others bagged many.'
  
  % MB: Vanya, the more I look at this example, the more I think it's not a good counterexample. The word "koeyma" is glossed as "big.ADV," suggesting that it's actually an adverbial modifying the verb.
\end{exe}

We note  that a small number of languages in our survey have lexical items that can be interpreted as either `many'/`much' or `all'/`every', i.e.\ they are compatible with both existential and universal quantificational force. We discuss this data further in \S\ref{alleverysection}.

\subsection{Expressing `all'/`every' \label{alleverysection}}

Approximately half of the languages in our survey (64\ofy) have at least one strategy for expressing universal quantification over individuals. Like in \S\ref{manymuchsection}, we find that Australian languages do not lexically distinguish between universal quantification over count nouns versus mass nouns, as in (\ref{univmasscount1}). (We take \textit{gaarra} `salt water' in (\ref{univmasscount3}) to be a mass noun.)

\begin{exe}
\ex  \textsc{Bardi (nPN: Nyulnyulan)} \hfill(\citealt{bowern12}) \label{univmasscount1}
\begin{xlist}
\ex %\textbf{Boonyja}gid ambooriny \textbf{boonyja} lagallagal ingarrganyinan barda.\\
\gll \textbf{Boonyja}=gid ambooriny \textbf{boonyja} lagal-lagal   i-nga-rr-ganyi-n-an barda.\\
all=\textsc{then} people all climb-\textsc{redup}  3-\textsc{pst-aug}-climb-\textsc{cont-rem.pst} away\\
`Then all the people were climbing up [to get away from the rising water].'\label{univmasscount2}

%Inyjoordina gaarra \textbf{boonyja}.\\
\ex \gll i-ny-joordi-na gaarra \textbf{boonyja}.\\
3\textsc{m-pst}-dry.up-\textsc{rem.pst} salt.water all\\
`The sea all dried up.'\label{univmasscount3} %(p.\ 710) 
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}


Furthermore,  Australian universal quantifiers do not lexically distinguish between quantification  over subparts of a singular count noun versus quantification over sets of individuals or mass nouns, as in (\ref{univex0}). (We take \textit{walaalu} `country' in (\ref{univex1}) to be a singular count noun.)

% MB: Vanya, if you think this isn't a good enough example of a singular count noun (I know, it's not great), we can switch to the old stingray example. I only took that one out because it was the same Bardi quantifier as in the above examples. --- IK: I think this one is swell! (I took some formatting liberties whilst looking at it, hope you don't mind)

\begin{exe}
 \ex \textsc{Gaagudju (nPN: Isolate)} \hfill (\citealt[307]{harvey92}) \label{univex0}
  \begin{xlist}
      \ex \gll walaalu $\varnothing$-naana \textbf{geegirr}.\\
    country \Cliv-burn.\Pp{} all\\
    \glt `The country is all burnt.' \label{univex1}
    \ex \gll djirriingi njinggooduwa yaa-bu=mba \textbf{geegirr}.\\
    man woman \Third\Cli-went=\Aug{} all\\
    \glt `The men and women have all gone.' \label{univex2}
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Australian universal quantifiers also do not appear to lexically distinguish between quantification over singular versus plural nouns, i.e.\ the distinction between English `every' and `all.' However, this generalization is hard to state definitively due to the fact that person and number agreement marking and plural nominal marking tend to be optional in some contexts in Australian languages ({\bf cite}). As a result, it can be difficult to diagnose whether a given quantifier is modifying a singular or a  plural noun. For now, we note simply that we have not found any universal force quantifier that must necessarily co-occur with either a singular or plural noun. %We show a (lack of) such a contrast in (\ref{}). 


We describe three primary strategies for expressing universal quantification over individuals, in the order of their frequency: (i) having a unique lexical item with universal force; (ii) having a single lexical item that is compatible with readings of both existential and universal force (i.e., `many' and `all'/`every'); and (iii)  morphologically deriving `all'/`every' from `many.'\footnote{An additional, uncommon strategy for encoding universal force appears to be the use of morphology encoding something like set closure; this gives rise to an exhaustive interpretation of the plural noun it combines with, resulting in a reading of universal quantification. We find possible set closure suffixes in only 3/64 languages in our sample. We note that the Warlpiri suffix \textit{-patu} in (\ref{patuex1}) is also used to express `several'/`a small number;' however, in examples like (\ref{patuex1}), it can be used to mark set closure regardless of the cardinality of the plural noun.

\begin{exe}
  \ex \textsc{Warlpiri (PN: Ngumpin-Yapa)}\hfill (\citealt[13--14]{bowler17})
  \gll Yapa-\textbf{patu}=ju, pina kulpaja=lu.\\
  person-\textsc{patu}=\textsc{top} again return.\textsc{pst}=\textsc{3pl.subj}\\
  \glt `[All] the people, they went back.'  \label{patuex1}
  % \ex \textsc{Martu Wangka (PN: Wati)} (\citealt[158]{marsh92}) \\
  % \gll Palu\textbf{-lyu}.\\
  % 3\textsc{sg}-\textsc{terminative}\\
  % \glt (1) `That's all.'\\
  % (2) `That's the lot.'
  \ex \textsc{Wambaya (nPN: Mirndi)}\hfill (\citealt[80]{nordlinger98})
  \gll Yarru irr-aji  alaji\textbf{-rdarra}.\\
  go  3\textsc{pl.s-hab.pst} boy.I-\textsc{group(nom)}\\
  \glt `All the boys used to go.' 
\end{exe}}

The most common of these strategies is having a unique lexical item with universal force; $\sim$45/64 languages use this strategy. These are primarily free lexical items; a very small number of (non-Pama-Nyungan) languages ($\sim$5/64) encode universal quantification  through suffixes. We give examples of quantifiers with strictly universal force in (\ref{univex3})--(\ref{univex5}).

\begin{exe}

 %   `...all the pelicans, all the herons, all the spoonbills...'

    \ex \textsc{Ngalakgan (nPN: Gunwinyguan)}\hfill (\citealt[160]{baker08}) \label{univex5}
\gll  miɻppara\textbf{-kappul}   ŋu-pu-woʔwo      jir-$\varnothing$-ŋowiɲ\\

    % ai bin gibit ola biganini, [mela] bin dagat na
         `I gave it [food] to all the children, and we ate.'
\end{exe}

The two other primary strategies for expressing universal quantification  involve lexical items for `many.' A small number of languages ($\sim$10/64) have quantifiers that appear to be ambiguous between existential and universal force, as in Gugada \textit{\charis{muɻga}} in  (\ref{manyallambig1}). A single lexical item can therefore be interpreted as `many' or `all'/`every,' depending on the context.\footnote{In Ngaliwuru (nPN: Mirndi), a single lexical item, \textit{mulu}, is glossed as both `all' and `three' (\citealt[77]{boltetal71}). This is the only language in our sample in which we observe this polysemy. However, \cite{platt72} notes that the lexical item \textit{{\charis{maɳgur}}} `all' in Gugada (PN: Thura-Yura) is historically derived from `three.'} At present, we speculate that these lexical items have an underlying meaning of `many' that can be strengthened to `all'/`every' in some contexts, perhaps pragmatically; however, much further fieldwork is needed to determine how and when this strengthening occurs.\footnote{\cite{bittnerhale95} give a semantic account of a Warlpiri quantifier, \textit{panu}, which can be variably interpreted as either `many' or `all'/`every.' They propose that in its existential strength reading, \textit{panu} is of the same semantic type as common nouns in Warlpiri (i.e., $<$e,t$>$). They derive its universal strength reading through a semantic type-shifting operation in which it can be interpreted definitely (i.e., as something of type $<$e$>$).} %This gives rise to its reading of universal strength.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex  \textsc{Gugada (PN: Thura-Yura)}\hfill (\citealt[56-65]{platt72}) \label{manyallambig1}

  \end{xlist}
 \end{exe}
 
 A still smaller number of languages morphologically derive their universal force quantifier from `many'; we observe this in only 6/64 languages in our sample.\footnote{We find evidence for the opposite pattern in one language, Yir Yoront. In this language, reduplicating the monomorphemic lexical item \textit{moqo} `all' yields the (existential force) value judgment quantifier `quite a few':

  \ex \textsc{Yir Yoront (PN: Paman)}\hfill (\citealt[375]{alpher73})\\
  \textit{\charis moqmor} `quite a few' $<^*$\textit{\charis moqo} `all'
\end{exe}}  Languages accomplish this  through a number of morphological strategies, primarily (i) the addition of a lexical item meaning `only' or `still,' as in (\ref{manyderive1});  and (ii) partial or total reduplication of `many,' as in (\ref{manyderive2}). Interestingly, we note that languages that morphologically derive their universal quantifiers from `many' (as their primary strategy for universal quantification) tend to be non-Pama-Nyungan.

\subsection{Expressing `several'/`a small number'}

Approximately half of the languages in our sample (63\ofy) have a strategy for expressing `several' or `a small number.'\footnote{We note that related quantifiers like English \textit{few} have an associated value judgment that the cardinality of the set they quantify over is below some contextually established expectation (\citealt{keenan17qu}). For the purpose of this chapter, we do not distinguish between quantificational expressions that do or do not have this value judgment. Overall, very few of our sources describe such a value judgment.} We describe four primary strategies for expressing `several': (i) having a lexical item that uniquely encodes `several'; (ii) having a lexical item that is polysemous between expressions of cardinality (e.g.\ \textit{two, three}) and `several'; (iii) morphologically deriving `several' from expressions of cardinality, typically through reduplication; and (iv) using a lexical item for `small' to express `several.'

Of the 63 languages in our sample with a strategy for expressing `several,' 41 of them have a unique lexical item with this meaning.\footnote{For the purpose of this count, we attempted to include only lexical items for `several' that are not explicitly described as being polysemous with/morphologically derived from numerals. However, due to gaps in the descriptions of these languages, we suspect that a number of the lexical items included in this tally are in fact related to numerals.} We give examples of two such lexical items in (\ref{warlpiriseveral1})-(\ref{awabakalseveral1}).

\end{exe}

$\sim$15/63 languages have lexical items that are polysemous between readings of cardinality (i.e., numerals) and vague readings of small quantity.  We find that the numerals used in these expressions range from one to four, as in (\ref{fewex0})-(\ref{fewex3}). `One' has a vague use in only one language in our sample, i.e., Mangarayi (nPN); \citet[93]{merlan89} notes that Mangarayi `one' can have a vague interpretation only in combination with inanimate nouns.\footnote{\citet[143]{bowernzentz12} also describe Warlmanpa (PN: Ngumpin-Yapa) as permitting a vague interpretation of `one.' However, we do not currently include Warlmanpa in our language sample.} (Since Australian counting systems have already been discussed at length in \cite{bowernzentz12}, we refer readers to their paper for discussion specifically on numerals. The findings of our study generally accord with their conclusions; for instance, they describe similar vague uses of numerals in their data.)
% MB: They say that no language has a vague use of the word for "two," though!

\end{exe}

A smaller number of languages ($<$10/63) morphologically derive their lexical item for `several' from numerals.\footnote{\citet[51]{alpher73} asserts that in Yir Yoront (PN: Paman), \textit{\charis{wapayər}} `three' is morphologically derived from \textit{wap} `few,' `some.'} This morphological derivation is typically accomplished through reduplication, as in (\ref{severalredup1}).

  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

$\sim$5/63 languages use a lexical item meaning `small'/`little' as a primary strategy for indicating a small amount. This parallels the use of `big' to express `much,' as described in \S\ref{manymuchsection}. As with the use of `big,' we find no examples of `small' being used in combination with count nouns to express `several'; rather, `small' is used to refer to small amounts of a mass quantity, e.g.\ \textit{kikakkin} `meat' in (\ref{ex:lil}).

There is a clear historical link between numerals and quantifier terms meaning `several'/`a small number' in many of the languages in our sample. This includes synchronic polysemies (as in (\ref{fewex0})-(\ref{fewex3})) as well as historical relationships between `several' and numerals (as in Warlpiri \textit{wirrkardu} (\ref{warlpiriseveral1})). We observe this tendency across both Pama-Nyungan and non-Pama-Nyungan languages, suggesting that it is relatively widespread across Australian languages.

\subsection{Expressing the partitive `some'}
\label{sec:some}
In this section we confine our attention to the partitive `some', i.e.\ the one that denotes a proportion, rather than the existential/indefinite marker `some' (which in English, for instance, can be phonologically reduced to [{\charis sm̩}], unlike the partitive one). Descriptions of 31 language in our sample report a strategy to express the meaning `some (of the \textit{n}s)'.\footnote{If our source on a given lexical item did not comment on its semantics, it was often not possible to tell with certainty which `some' we were dealing with and the decision was hard to make in many such cases. Given that the grammatical marking of definiteness is not a feature frequently found in Australian languages, we would normally give the borderline cases the benefit of the doubt and count them as partitives. We would also like to underscore that we are not suggesting an Anglocentric point of view where a lexical item is necessarily at risk of such ambiguity; rather, our concern stems from the fact that our sources are all in English. Whenever the English translation/gloss is all the information we have on a given lexical item, this uncertainty arises due to the ambiguity in English.} %@ a reference is needed for the definiteness claim in the fn.
Among these languages, at least 14 have polysemy of `some' and `other', i.e.\ use the lexical item meaning `(an)other' (or `different') to express the partitive `some' (\ref{ex:smotherbur}--\ref{ex:smothernyan}). Over a half languages (n = 18) use a dedicated lexical item for the partitive `some' (\ref{ex:specsmawa}--\ref{ex:specsmwlg}).

\end{exe}

The scalar implicature `some but not all', which is the most reliable characteristic of the partitive `some' (as opposed to the indefinite `some'), is a fine semantic judgement that requires careful testing in context. Unfortunately, such information is largely unavailable in the presently available sources, with the scalar implicature confirmed explicitly only for a handful of languages. % looks like pitjantjatjara, umpila, murrinhpatha, kunbarlang, and judging from exx probably also burarra, nyangumarta, maybe awabakal

% IK: So there are a few cells where there is a "no" for the L having a `some' expression, but it just looks to me like some Nick bullshit. I.e. he didn't see one and concluded there wasn't one. That's clearly so for the two Giimbiyu Ls (and then for the third one, mengerrdji, he says "yes", apparently b/c there's a little table that has a word for `other' !!!), and I believe I checked the garadjari and umbugarla as well.

\subsection{Constituent negation
\label{sec:neg}}

%expressions indicating that the intersection of the sets of relevant individuals is empty (English: \textit{No dogs ran}). 

For a complete survey of negation in Australian languages, we refer the reader to \textbf{XXXX}, this volume. In this section, we focus solely on expressions of constituent negation, e.g.\ English \textit{no dogs}. We find that approximately two thirds of the languages in our sample (84\ofy) have a strategy for expressing constituent negation.  We identify two primary morphosyntactic  strategies for this purpose: (i) using privative nominal suffixes, and (ii) using free, uninflected lexical items.\footnote{A very small number of languages in our sample use morphosyntactically complex, bipartite strategies to express constituent negation.

\begin{exe}
  \ex \textsc{Wambaya (nPN: Mirndi)} \hfill (\citealt[204]{nordlinger98})

  \gll \textbf{wala} mathan\textbf{-pira}\\
  \textsc{neg} limb-having.\\
  \glt `There are no sticks.'% (p.\ 74)
\end{exe}}

33/84 languages in our sample use privative nominal suffixes to express constituent negation, as in (\ref{privexist1})-(\ref{privexist3}). Privatives typically express {\it without N} or \textit{lacking N}; as a result, these suffixes often occur in possessive expressions. We find that privative suffixes are primarily a feature of Pama-Nyungan languages; only three non-Pama-Nyungan languages in our sample (Alawa, Wagiman, and Wardaman) are described as having privative suffixes.\footnote{Since property concepts like \textit{tall, short}, etc.\ are typically encoded as nouns in Australian languages, privative suffixes are also often used to express the absence of a given property, as in (\ref{privproperty1}).

\subsection{Indefinite pronouns}
\label{sec:indefs}
Lexical items for expression of indefinites (e.g.\ \textit{someone}, \textit{nothing}, \textit{anywhere}, \textit{whoever}, and so on) and ignoratives (e.g.\ \textit{whatchamacallit}) are reported in 43\ofy languages in our sample. In the vast majority of these languages (36/43), the indefinite pronouns are based on the interrogatives. These languages can be divided into two groups:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Languages in which the indefinite pronouns are identical in form to \textit{Wh}-words (25 languages), i.e.\ one form is ambiguous between interrogative and indefinite readings (\ref{ex:blnidf})
\item Languages in which there is a morphological operation (optional or obligatory) deriving indefinites from \textit{Wh}-words (at least 11 languages, see below)
\end{enumerate}
\begin{exe}
  % \ex\label{ex:gniidf} \textsc{Gooniyandi (nPN: Bunaban)} (\citealt[147]{mcgregor90})\\
  % \gll \textbf{ngoonyi}-yidda wardginggiri.\\
  % which-\All{} you.go\\

  who-\Erg-\Dub{} hit-\Pst{}\\
  \glt (1) `Who hit him?'\\
  (2) `Maybe someone hit him.'
\end{exe}

This frequent functional duality of the same form is the subject of a (smaller scale) typological study by \citet{mushin95}. She suggests that their epistemological contribution is the basis for such functional development, and coins the term \textit{epistememe} for the forms that serve ontological categorization of discourse referents and may take on interrogative, indefinite, hesitation and complementizing functions. We further find that oftentimes the identical forms will have different distributional tendencies, e.g.\ when used as interrogatives these pronouns will appear clause-initially, but enjoy more freedom of placement when used as indefinites (\ref{ex:bkwidf}).
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:bkwidf} \textsc{Bininj Kun-wok (nPN: Gunwinyguan)}\hfill \pgcitep{evans03}{280--1}

    `and if we get something\ldots' % ex 7.90
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In the languages that can or must differentiate the interrogatives and indefinites morphologically, the latter are typically derived via an indefinite, ignorative, or dubitative affix/particle (\ref{ex:idftime}), or via reduplication (\ref{ex:idfrdp}).\footnote{Interestingly, Bardi (nPN: Nyulnyulan) can express the indefinite pronoun `something' using a compound of `who' and `nose': \textit{angginimal} `something' [lit.\ \textit{anggaba} `who' + \textit{niimal} `nose'] (\citealt[321]{bowern12}).}

  % \end{xlist}

The negative indefinites are often formed from the \textit{wh}-words via adding a negative particle (i.e.\ ``not who'' for `nobody'; see (\ref{ex:negidf})). A recurrent analytical problem with such constructions is whether they form a genuine negative indefinite series in a given language or rather are existential quantifiers (i.e.\ plain indefinites) in scope of negation. %%Possible arguments in favour of this grammaticalising into a dedicated indefinite series
Relevant properties that can help decide include e.g.\ (un)usual word order of negation marker (as in Kunbarlang, where the negative particle immediately precedes the verb, but in clauses with such indefinites it precedes the interrogative/indefinite) or (un)availability of alternative constructions (e.g.\ the negation only expressed in the verb).

\end{exe}

Besides this major strategy of forming indefinites from interrogatives, there are two minor trends. One is the employment of generic nouns or classifiers (\ref{indetclass1}) to fulfil the indefinite pronoun function, found in 6 languages in our sample. The other option, of course, is for the language to have dedicated lexical items for indefinites and/or ignoratives. We have identified 8 languages that have such items.

  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Although indefinite pronouns, often directly associated with existential and universal quantifiers in semantic analyses, are a prime tool for the study of scope ambiguities and quantifier interaction, we do not find discussion of these issues in the currently available descriptions. %@ and add something else here to sum it up.
%@ IK: also, I haven't really talked about their semantics much --- I guess I'll need to expand

\subsection{Temporal quantifiers}
\label{sec:tempq}
Descriptions for nearly a half of the languages in the sample (54\ofy) contain descriptions or at least mentions of temporal quantifiers. These are the expressions that count or measure time intervals, or more broadly, cases (i.e.\ instantiations of particular event types), viz.\ `often', `sometimes', `always', `never', etc. In terms of their morphosyntax, the absolute majority of temporals are free adverbs (\ref{ex:gniagain}) and other kinds of A-quantifiers: clitics (e.g., Alyawarra =\textit{antiya} `still; always'), verbal affixes (e.g., Nhirrpi -\textit{parapara} `often'; \ref{ex:oftsuff}), % also: bkw and garadjari
nominal affixes (e.g., Kalkatungu -\textit{ŋujan} `(x many) times'; see \ref{ex:manytimes} below), and even verbal roots (in Burarra (\ref{ex:valways}; also \ref{indetclass1}), Pintupi and Yugambeh). Although most TQs are A-quantifiers, we notice that they are often derived from D-quantifiers. This is in line with the observations in \citealt{gil93,keenanpaperno17ov}.

A noticable number of languages (n = 24) have a way to encode the meaning `\textit{n} many times', which we call `times'-adverbials. In the majority of cases (n = 14) these are built with a `times'-affix (Djabugay and Djinang have a free particle, rather than an affix). Such an affix attaches to a (D-)quantifier---often a cardinal numeral,---forming a `times'-adverbial (\ref{ex:manytimes}). The other two patterns are also derivational. Five languages derive the `times'-adverbial from a D-quantifier by a non-specialised affix, such as limitative or a case marker (\ref{ex:dattimes}). Still in other four languages %a construction with
the noun meaning `arm' (`finger' in Yir Yoront) combined with a quantifier % is used
yields a `times'-adverbial construction (\ref{ex:2arm}).

Finally, Yir Yoront has a simplex lexical item \textit{tonolt} meaning `once', and Waluwara there is an example of the causative/verbaliser -\textit{\charis ma} attaching to the numeral \textit{\charis kutja} `two', resulting in the verb \textit{\charis kutjama} `to do something twice'. %breen71:113

In terms of semantics of the temporal quantifiers, most often reported are the universal strength ones (i.e., `always' (\ref{ex:valways}), `forever' (\ref{ex:4eva}), et seq.; n = 39). % 34 always's + 5 4evers
Existentials are described in 12 languages, including meanings like `sometimes' (\ref{ex:smtms}), `often' (\ref{ex:oftsuff}) or `few times'. Three sources mention a negative temporal quantifier `never' (\ref{ex:never}).

At least four languages in our sample exhibit an interesting polysemy of existential quantifiers, which are able to range either over individuals (`some') or over times (`sometimes'); in other words, they alternate between A- and D-quantifier morphosyntax. These languages are Djinang, Kunbarlang, Mawng and Yir Yoront. This polysemy does not correlate with weak distinction between adjectives and adverbs in a language---for instance, in Kunbarlang they are distinct categories. Thus, the Mawng word \textit{yara} in (\ref{ex:smtms}) means `sometimes' and is a temporal adverbial, but in (\ref{ex:dyara}) means `some' and is a modifier for the nominal \textit{ja kiyap} `\Clm{} fish':

\subsection{Quantifier interaction}
\label{sec:qfrscope}
Scope possibilities of quantifiers with respect to each other (e.g.\ \textit{Someone knows everyone}) and to other operators is a classic topic in the quantifier literature, \marginnote{cite the collection Ways of Scope Taking maybe?} and has also been used extensively as a diagnostic for structural relations in many languages. Another example of quantifier interaction is building of complex quantifiers from simpler ones via, for instance, boolean compounding (\textit{not more than five}). Description of such matters in Australian languages is in its infancy, with very examples found in the literature.

In Wubuy, bare common nouns scope underneath or above negation depending on the presence (resp., absence) of a class prefix (\ref{ex:nuyscope}). \citet{baker08} analyses these prefixes as topic markers, serving to indicate the scope of clausal operators.

\subsection{`How many'/`how much'}
\label{sec:howmany}
We notice that many languages lexicalize the interrogative meaning `how many'. More precisely, just over one third of the languages in the sample (44\ofy) have a unique, non-periphrastic way to inquire about the quantity (\ref{ex:npnhm}, \ref{ex:pnhm}). This prevalence of lexicalization for `how many' suggests that the concept of quantity may be more salient in Australian cultures than the received wisdom has it. 
\begin{exe}

  how.many \Ignor{} two foot two hand boomerang-\Pl{} maybe\\
  \glt `How many were there? Maybe twenty boomerangs (lit.\ two hands and two feet of boomerangs).'
\end{exe}

Further 14 languages have other ways to form such questions, either through morphological derivation from other \textit{wh}-words (\ref{ex:hmwhatq}, \ref{howmanyex2}), or through periphrastic constructions (\ref{ex:hmprph}) or with \textit{wh}-words polysemous between quantity and other categories (\ref{ex:whathm}).

In line with the weak distinction between mass and count nouns, noted above, we find that in a number of languages the same word can be used with (notionally) count nouns for `how many' (\ref{ex:hmcnt}) and (notionally) mass nouns for `how much' (\ref{ex:hmmass}).
%  One lexical item can express both `how many' and `how much': %@ do smth about the meat-classifier so that it doesn't look like mass noun "roo meat"
